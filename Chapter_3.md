# Chapter 3: Understanding All CPU Rings in Linux

## 3.1 What Are CPU Rings?
CPU rings are hardware-enforced privilege levels in the x86 architecture. They control access to resources like memory, I/O ports, and CPU instructions. The lower the ring number, the higher the privilege.

There are four rings:

| Ring | Privilege Level | Typical Use Case |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| 0    | Highest         | Kernel (OS core) |
| 1    | High            | Device drivers (rarely) |
| 2    | Medium          | Middleware (rarely) |
| 3    | Lowest          | User applications |


## 3.2 Ring 0: Kernel Mode
- **Who runs here?** The Linux kernel.
- **Capabilities:**
  - Full access to hardware.
  - Can execute privileged CPU instructions.
  - Can manage memory, processes, and devices.
- **Examples:**
  - System call handlers.
  - Interrupt service routines.
  - Kernel modules and drivers (in Linux, even drivers run in Ring 0).


## 3.3 Ring 1 and Ring 2: Rarely Used
- **Who runs here?** Almost nothing in modern Linux.
- **Why?**
  - Linux and most modern OSes use a two-ring model (Ring 0 and Ring 3).
  - Rings 1 and 2 were originally intended for device drivers or OS services with limited privileges.

- **Modern Alternative:**
  - Linux uses kernel modules and user-space drivers instead.
  - Virtualization and containerization provide more flexible isolation.



## 3.4 Ring 3: User Mode
- **Who runs here?** All user-space applications.
- **Capabilities:**
  - Cannot access hardware directly.
  - Must use system calls to request kernel services.
  - Isolated from other processes and the kernel.
- **Examples:**
  - Web browsers, text editors, games, shells, etc.



## 3.5 Why Only Rings 0 and 3 in Linux?
Linux simplifies privilege separation by using just two levels:

- **Ring 0:** Full control (kernel)
- **Ring 3:** Restricted execution (user apps)

**This design:**
- Reduces complexity.
- Improves performance.
- Leverages virtual memory and system call interfaces for isolation and control.



### Bonus: Rings in Virtualization
In virtualized environments, there's a concept of **Ring -1**:

- **Ring -1:** Used by hypervisors (e.g., KVM, Xen)
- Allows the hypervisor to control guest OSes running in Ring 0.
